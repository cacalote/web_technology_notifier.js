# Web Technology Notifier

Web Technology Notifier displays the technology that is executed by the Web server of the current page through an icon.  Many modules and CMS can be identified, such as Phusion Passenger for Ruby applications (as Ruby on Rails and Sinatra frameworks), PHP based applications (like Zend Server or iPyramid), Zope (Python powered), Microsoft ASP.NET, and more.

This notifier can display more information when clicked.

## Philosophy

Being a general extension that does only one thing, without any feature.
